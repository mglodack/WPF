## Things to look for while code reviewing a Pull Request

1. Class Method naming
	1. Method names should be a verb that makes sense
2. Class Property / Field naming
	1. Properties/Fields should be explicit
3. Class namespce
	1. If a new class is created, does it exist in a proper namespace
4. Method namespace
	1. If a new method is added to a current class, then does it make sense for that method to exist there
5. Comments for future reference
	1. I'm not a big fan, but comments are important for future reference
